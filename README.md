# *My* cheat sheets

These are some cheat sheets used (and sometimes made) by me.

I follow those when programming in C#.

## [GitHub's git cheat sheet](https://help.github.com/articles/git-cheatsheet)

I use this cheat sheet for the practical part of my git talks/trainings.

## [IANA's HTTP method registry](IANA's HTTP method registry.md) & [RFC 7231 HTTP status codes](RFC 7231 HTTP status codes.md)

Just to [rest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) assured.

## [Rich Hickey's Toolkits](Rich Hickey's Toolkits.md)

Who doesn't love Rich Hickey?
